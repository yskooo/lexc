# LexC
Lightweight Enhanced eXecution Code (Lex-C)

Lightweight Enhanced Execution Code, or Lex-C, is a programming language made
for "newbie coders". Its goal is to help new learners focus on problem-solving and logic rather
than memorizing complicated commands. Inspired by the pioneer language C, Lex-C employs
concise and intuitive words to ensure writing code feels natural and unambiguous.

This new programming language follows an imperative approach to coding. It keeps only
the basic and important features of the C language while focusing on making the syntax clear and
simple. To achieve this, only a few easy-to-understand reserved words and functions were used.

Lex-C seeks to address common challenges in readability and syntax understanding by
applying a simpler lexical and syntactical design, while retaining the efficiency and procedural
nature of C. Replacing unnecessary and cryptic syntax (technical jargon) with a more natural
language makes it easier to read, understand, and maintain code, especially for beginners. This
provides an avenue where learners can focus more on developing programs without being
overwhelmed by the language's syntactic complexity.
